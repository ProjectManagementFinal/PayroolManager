The "skeleton" of the project is currently being worked on. Basic functions that will show an employees characteristics. Things like their account username and password, their job
title, the sales they made and finally what their monthly/annual income will be. We still have to decide what values we want to give for certain values like base salary, and benefits. This is the basis of the project, creating a portal for a company to calculate their paycheck and so that their employees can view important information about their jobs (money, shifts, sales ranking, etc.). 
Also, Adam is currently working on the GUI processor so the program can be implemented in this manner. We are working on the GUI Processor more in depth before continuing with more complex code so that we know how we are going to implement the program into it. However some of the things to expect are but are not limited to: set a method that will block the account if the user incorrectly enters the username and password after 3 attempts.
employees data, we plan to have around 40, all with unique characteristics that would distinguish them, the company has different locations and if you fit the requirements you could ask for a transfer to another city . We hope to implement all of this by the end of the week and put it together with the GUI processor. 
Once thats done, we're free to implement whatever else we deem important, think could 
improve the program and be beneficial to the project as a whole.
